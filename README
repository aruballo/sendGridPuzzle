My executable for the SendGrid solution.
The exectuble is in sendGrid->Debug->sendGrid.exe.
I included all the project files in case they were neccessary to run 
the executable, but I believe all that is needed is to have
C++ installed on your computer. The Java source code and 
C++ source code are also included. They are the two text
files in the main directory of this repo.

Thanks,
Antonio
